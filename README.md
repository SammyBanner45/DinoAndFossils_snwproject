# DinoAndFossils_snwproject

creator: Sambuddha Banerjee

This website, Dinos & Fossils: Unearthing Ancient Worlds, was created as part of a web development project at Newton School of Technology. It combines science and creativity to explore the fascinating world of dinosaurs, fossils, and paleontological discoveries through an interactive, educational experience. The project reflects my passion for both technology and natural history, showcasing how digital design can bring ancient stories to life.

A webpage project built using HTML and CSS, exploring the fascinating world of dinosaurs, fossils, and paleology.

Usage of various topics from HTML, like forms, table, sections, anchor tag, id, class, header, nav, footer, div, p tags, etc., and CSS properties,like margin, padding, color, background-color, flex, position, transition, pseudo class, etc. is visible in the code of this webpage.

This project demonstrates core front-end skills using only HTML and CSS, focusing on structure, styling, and responsive design.
It is built entirely on my present knowledge regarding HTML and CSS and all structures and design has been overtaken all by me with a little assist from internet for learning new things and add to my knowledge.
